To build any mod projects, you must manually copy required DLL files from the game into this folder.

PLEASE use an [Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer), otherwise there is a chance of
load failure. With that program I linked, you can just drag any DLL onto the executable (in Windows file explorer) and
it should send the publicized assembly to a new folder.

Required files:

1. Aloft\Aloft_Data\Managed\Aloft.dll
2. Aloft\Aloft_Data\Managed\Fusion.Runtime.dll
