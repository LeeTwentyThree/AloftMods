# Lee23's Aloft Mods

All of my mods use BepInEx 5. I tested them with [this version](https://www.nexusmods.com/aloft/mods/1).

## Local build instructions

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Place the required assemblies in the Dependencies folder. Check the README in that folder for more details.
3. Open the desired project with an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio, Rider, etc.).
4. Restore the NuGet packages if you encounter any issues with loading the packages.
5. You should now be able to build each project individually.
